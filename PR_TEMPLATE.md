# Fix GroupMe OAuth Integration

## Description

This PR fixes the GroupMe OAuth integration that was causing 500 errors when users tried to connect their GroupMe accounts from the sidebar. The integration now correctly uses OAuth 2.0 implicit flow to connect user accounts.

## Root Causes Fixed

1. **TypeScript Return Type Errors**: Fixed return types in controller functions
2. **Authentication Middleware Issue**: Made the callback route publicly accessible
3. **Path Mismatch**: Added a route handler to forward requests to the correct API path
4. **OAuth Endpoint Mismatch**: Ensured the correct OAuth endpoint is used with cache busting

## Changes Made

- Updated return types in `groupMe.controller.ts` from `Promise<void>` to `Promise<Response>`
- Moved the implicit grant callback route before the auth middleware in `groupMe.routes.ts`
- Added a direct route handler for `/groupme/callback` in `index.ts`
- Added validation and cache busting for OAuth URLs in frontend components
- Added detailed logging to help diagnose any future issues

## Testing Done

- Created a test script (`test-groupme-oauth.js`) to simulate the GroupMe OAuth flow
- Tested with a valid user ID from the database
- Verified the token is saved correctly in the database
- Confirmed the user is redirected to the success page
