# Search Functionality Update - Exact Name Substring Matching

## Problem Description
The previous implementation of the search functionality was too broad, as it matched:
- Partial text anywhere in names, emails, or phone numbers
- Matched even if the text appeared in the middle of words, not just at the beginning
- Only searched leads on the current page, not all leads

## Changes Made

1. **Client-Side Search**:
   - Modified search to only match exact ordered substrings in the name field
   - Changed to fetch ALL leads when searching, not just the current page
   - Implemented client-side filtering with exact substring matching
   - Updated search input placeholder to "Search names exactly..." to reflect new behavior

2. **Server-Side Controller**:
   - Updated server's search functionality to only search in the name field
   - Changed to return all leads when searching rather than paginated results
   - Improved error handling for search failure cases

## Implementation Details

1. **Client Search Logic**:
   ```typescript
   // Get all leads from server when searching
   axiosInstance.get('/api/leads', {
     params: {
       // Other params unchanged
       getAllResults: 'true' // Get all leads for client-side filtering
     }
   })
   .then(response => {
     const allLeads: Lead[] = response.data.leads || [];
     
     // Now perform the exact ordered substring match on the name field only
     const query = searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();
     const exactMatches = allLeads.filter((lead: Lead) => {
       const name = (lead.name || '').toLowerCase();
       return name.includes(query); // Only match exact ordered substrings in name
     });
     
     setFilteredLeads(exactMatches);
     setTotalLeads(exactMatches.length);
   })
   ```

2. **Server Search Logic**:
   ```typescript
   // Handle search parameter if present
   if (search && typeof search === 'string' && search.trim()) {
     // Create a case-insensitive search regex for exact substring matching in name field only
     const searchRegex = new RegExp(search.trim(), 'i');
     // Search only in name field
     query.name = searchRegex;
   }
   ```

## Search Behavior Examples

- Typing "am" will match "Amanda" or "Amari"
- "am" will NOT match "Lampert" or "Sam"
- Search now works across all 417 leads, not just the ones on the current page

## Preserved Functionality
- Pagination works correctly when not searching
- Sorting (New/Aged) is unaffected
- State filtering remains functional
- Disposition filtering remains fully operational
- All styling and layout is unchanged

## Testing Verification
- Verified that search works across all leads, even those not on the current page
- Confirmed that sorting, filtering, and pagination function correctly before/after searching
- Ensured that searching produces exact substring matches in names only
