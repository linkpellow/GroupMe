# NextGen Lead Notification Enhancements - Multi-line Layout & System Notifications

## Background and Motivation

### Current Request
User wants to enhance the NextGen lead notification system with two key improvements:

**Step 1:** Modify the notification banner layout so the lead name appears underneath "New NextGen Lead!" text instead of inline, with a visually pleasing, dopamine-triggering design.

**Current format:** `"New NextGen Lead! Afshin Hasankhani"` (single line)
**Desired format:** 
```
New NextGen Lead!
Afshin Hasankhani
```

**Step 2:** Enable system-level notifications that work even when the browser tab or window is not active, using professional best practices.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

## Lessons

### Technical Lessons Learned
1. **System Notification Best Practices:** Always request permissions with user-friendly context and handle graceful degradation
2. **Component Architecture:** Separating notification display logic from system notification logic maintains clean code organization
3. **Browser Compatibility:** Chrome has stricter autoplay policies that require specific workarounds for audio
4. **Memory Management:** Notification cleanup and deduplication prevents memory leaks in long-running applications

### Professional Development Insights
1. **Evidence-Based Implementation:** Reading existing code thoroughly before making changes prevents breaking existing functionality
2. **User Experience Focus:** Permission requests should be contextual and user-friendly rather than technical
3. **Error Handling Priority:** Comprehensive error handling is essential for notification systems that interact with browser APIs
4. **Testing Strategy:** Debug panels and testing utilities are valuable for complex notification systems
