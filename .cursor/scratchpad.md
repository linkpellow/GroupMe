# Crokodial CRM Development Session

## üéØ Current Context (Updated: July 20, 2025)

### Project Status
- **Lead Count**: ~2,182+ leads in production database
- **Active Integrations**: 
  - ‚úÖ Twilio (calls/SMS) - Production ready
  - ‚úÖ NextGen (webhook lead import) - Production ready  
  - ‚úÖ Calendly (appointment booking) - Production ready
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è USHA & Ringy - Integration status needs verification
- **Performance Metrics**: 
  - Lead list render: ~800ms for 500+ leads (NEEDS OPTIMIZATION)
  - Search response: Client-side filtering (CRITICAL ISSUE - breaks at 500+ leads)
  - Memory usage: Potential leaks in long-running sessions
- **Security Status**: 
  - ‚ùå JWT stored in localStorage (CRITICAL VULNERABILITY)
  - ‚ùå API keys exposed in code (SECURITY RISK)
  - ‚úÖ Multi-tenant rule in place (basic protection)

### Critical Technical Debt (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)
1. **Monolithic Components** (UNACCEPTABLE):
   - `Leads.tsx`: 6,879 lines (MUST break down to <500 lines each)
   - `Dialer.tsx`: 3,506 lines (MUST refactor immediately)
2. **Security Vulnerabilities** (CRITICAL):
   - JWT localStorage ‚Üí httpOnly cookies migration required
   - API key environment variable migration required
   - Rate limiting implementation required
3. **Performance Issues** (BLOCKING SCALE):
   - Client-side filtering fails with 2,000+ leads
   - Server-side pagination implementation required
   - React.memo optimization needed for large lists
4. **Testing Gap** (PROFESSIONAL STANDARD):
   - Current coverage: ~0% (UNACCEPTABLE)
   - Target: 80% minimum for new code
   - Jest + Cypress setup required

## üìã Background & Motivation

### Current Session Focus
[Describe what we're working on in this session]

### Business Context
- **Industry**: CRM/Lead Management System
- **Scale**: Multi-tenant, 2,000+ leads per user
- **Critical Features**: Lead import, call tracking, disposition management
- **Revenue Impact**: Call tracking affects billing, lead management affects conversion

## üîç Technical Debt Analysis

### Component Size Violations (>500 lines)
```bash
# Current violations requiring immediate refactoring:
dialer-app/client/src/pages/Leads.tsx: 6,879 lines
dialer-app/client/src/components/Dialer.tsx: 3,506 lines
# Additional components to audit:
find dialer-app/client/src -name "*.tsx" -exec wc -l {} + | awk '$1 > 500'
```

### Security Audit Status
- [ ] JWT migration from localStorage to httpOnly cookies
- [ ] API keys moved to environment variables
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented on auth endpoints
- [ ] Input validation with Zod schemas
- [ ] Multi-tenant data isolation verified
- [ ] CSRF protection implemented

### Performance Bottlenecks
- [ ] Server-side pagination for lead lists
- [ ] React.memo for expensive component renders
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for 1000+ item lists
- [ ] MongoDB query optimization with proper indexing
- [ ] Memory leak prevention in long-running sessions

### Testing Implementation Plan
- [ ] Jest setup with 80% coverage requirement
- [ ] React Testing Library for component tests
- [ ] Cypress for E2E testing
- [ ] Multi-tenant security test suite
- [ ] Performance benchmark tests

## üîí Multi-Tenant Security Checklist

### Current Session Verification
- [ ] All new queries include proper userId/tenantId scoping
- [ ] No cross-tenant data leakage possible
- [ ] Authentication/authorization properly implemented
- [ ] API endpoints validate user ownership of resources
- [ ] Database queries filtered at ORM level (not just controller)

### Security Test Coverage
- [ ] User A cannot access User B's leads
- [ ] API endpoints return 403 for unauthorized access
- [ ] Bulk operations respect tenant boundaries
- [ ] File uploads scoped to user
- [ ] Search results filtered by user
