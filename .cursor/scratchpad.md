## **üîç Key Challenges & Technical Analysis**

### **Technical Architecture Challenges**
1. **MongoDB Query Complexity**: Implementing efficient distinct queries with proper filtering
2. **Multi-tenant Data Isolation**: All queries must respect `tenantId` boundaries  
3. **Performance Optimization**: Distinct queries can be expensive on large collections
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Cannot break existing functionality
5. **Real-time Updates**: UI must reflect data changes immediately
6. **Geographic Data Processing**: State-level aggregation for map visualizations

### **Business Logic Complexities**
1. **Auto-Quality Assignment**: Automatically mark source codes as "Quality" when leads convert to SOLD
2. **Override Protection**: Allow manual quality changes while preserving auto-assignments
3. **Time-based Analytics**: Support weekly, monthly, yearly, and all-time reporting periods
4. **Cost Calculations**: Accurate CPA computation with proper price field handling
5. **Geographic Analysis**: State-level performance tracking with interactive visualizations

### **Risk Assessment Matrix**
| Risk Level | Components | Mitigation Strategy |
|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Zero Risk** ‚úÖ | Backward-compatible data additions | Our target approach |
| **Low Risk** ‚úÖ | Enhance existing functions, add simple data | Professional testing |
| **Medium Risk** ‚ö†Ô∏è | New routes, state management changes | Isolated implementation |
| **High Risk** üö´ | Complex aggregations, UI overhauls | Avoided completely |
