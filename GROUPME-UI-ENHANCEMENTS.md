## Technical Implementation

All enhancements were implemented using React and Chakra UI components. We focused on:

1. **Component-based architecture**: Each feature was implemented as a reusable component
2. **Responsive design**: All elements work well on both desktop and mobile
3. **Performance optimization**: Used React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
4. **Accessibility**: Ensured all interactive elements are keyboard accessible and have proper ARIA labels
5. **Visual consistency**: Maintained consistent styling with GroupMe's design language

## Next Steps

1. **Real-time features**: Connect typing indicators to real WebSocket events
2. **Media support**: Implement actual image/GIF upload functionality
3. **Emoji picker**: Add a full emoji picker for reactions and messages
4. **Performance optimization**: Further optimize rendering for large message lists
5. **Accessibility improvements**: Add screen reader support and keyboard navigation
